Diagnosis Report
----------------
Time: 2026-02-05
Python Version: 3.14.2 (Bleeding Edge)
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (Compute Capability 12.0)

Action Taken:
1. Removed incompatible torch packages.
2. Attempted install of Nightly PyTorch for Python 3.14.
   - cu121: Not available.
   - cu124: Not available.
   - cu126: Installed (version 2.11.0.dev20260205+cu126).

Result:
- Installation: Successful.
- CUDA Detection: Successful (torch.cuda.is_available() is True).
- Kernel Execution: FAILED.
  The installed PyTorch version (cu126) likely does not yet support Compute Capability 12.0 (RTX 50 series) fully, or Python 3.14 interactions are unstable.

Recommendation:
- If possible, use Python 3.12 for better compatibility.
- Ensure NVIDIA Drivers are updated to support CUDA 12.6/13.0.
